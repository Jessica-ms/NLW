## 📚 About the project

This project was developed on the Next Level Week #02 event by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) 🚀&nbsp;💜

This application is designed to connect teachers and students. For teachers, it is possible to define the start and end time of classes, the hourly price and describe themselves. Studens can get in touch and choose favorites teachers.
